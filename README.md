# UFOs

This project is for displaying and filtering UFO sighting information.

We build a table using data stored in a JavaScript array and create filters to make this table fully dynamic, meaning that it will react to user input, and then place the table and an article about UFOs into an HTML file for easy viewing. We also customize the webpage using Bootstrap, and equip your table with several fully functional filters that will allow users to interact with our visualizations. 

## Resouces

- ES6+
- JavaScript library: D3.js
- Bootstrap

## Future work

- Display the table with limited rows and create "next" button to show rest of rows
- Add some web scraping features.
