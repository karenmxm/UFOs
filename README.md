# UFOs

We build a table using data stored in a JavaScript array and create filters to make this table fully dynamic, meaning that it will react to user input, and then place the table into an HTML file for easy viewing. We also customize the webpage using Bootstrap, and equip your table with several fully functional filters that will allow users to interact with our visualizations.
